----

Note: This proposal is the first to try a new process where we avoid creating excess issues with locked discussions. Discussion about this proposal should happen on this PR, preferably inline where possible.

Note 2: Riot/synapse is going ahead and trying out the registration portion of this proposal to fix a UX bug. Given UI auth has fallback support, this should not break any clients and can be easily modified in the future if this proposal were to change. Implementation is required as a proof of concept for the proposal anyways.
