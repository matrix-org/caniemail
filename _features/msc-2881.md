- [Show albums for multiple images](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/5872)
- [Message attachments (multiple photos, files, other messages for forwarding, etc)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2289)
- [Redesign: timeline: implement new file transfer UX](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/7565
- https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/13

Also lookup alternative and more optimal implementation: #3382
