A proposal for letting ASes specify event parents and timestamps when submitting events, letting them much more effectively incrementally insert past conversation history.  This is getting increasingly topical given the need to bridge existing conversation archives from existing chat systems into Matrix.  Fixes most of https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/698 hopefully.
