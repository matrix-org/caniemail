This partially replaces [MSC2962](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2962).

This is implemented by Synapse as an experimental room version in matrix-org/synapse#10254 (see matrix-org/synapse#9717 / matrix-org/synapse#9735 for a prior iteration).

[FCP proposal](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083#issuecomment-856914551)
