[Rendered](https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/math/proposals/1722-math.md)

I keep switching between preferring MathML or LaTeX.  This proposal proposes MathML, but investigates LaTeX as an alternative enough to hint as to what a fully worked-out LaTeX proposal might look like.

This proposal is related to https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/1945
