In matrix we already have vibrant discussions going on in rooms, but we often miss a fair method to resolve a dispute between several parties.

This proposal improve matrix by adding several methods to fairly choose between several options by:
- Defining the standard shape for extensible challenges messages, such as
    - Rock/Paper/scissors
    - Coin Flip
    - Drawing Straws

- Defining extensible commitment schemes allowing to define the level for binding vs concealing property of the challenge
