This was originally put together as notes of an IRL chat with the intention of turning it into a proper public MSC asap... except it got completely blocked on me wanting to first get alignment between whether to use discourse & github before releasing it (and then getting sucked into other stuff).

Releasing it now better late than never, as it overlaps significantly with #1421.

Best place for discussion is probably #matrix-spec-process:matrix.org or #discourse-matrix-spec:thebeckmeyers.xyz (the one for #1421)
