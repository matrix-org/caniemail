This is a placeholder for a future MSC to document a proposal for the antivirus stuff we've been experimenting with recently, which amounts to a set of new APIs which proxy access to the media repository via an AV scanner server, whilst giving a way for clients to send encrypted E2E attachment keys to the AV scanner (if they want) so the scanner can scan the content before handing the response back to the client.  https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-content-scanner is the experimental implementation and contains the API doc which would need to make it into a MSC.
