This didn't really pass review; there was a discussion of mapping it into iCal instead as per https://gist.github.com/ara4n/2ee771eb69580125e5b5756872a842be - meanwhile, it turns out that IETF is doing jsCalendar https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-calext-jscalendar/ which looks very similar and would be an actual standards-based solution for this.

Meanwhile the overall discussion then got sidetracked into extensible events as per https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1225
