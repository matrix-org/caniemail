This is a MSC proposal generated in response to the feedback on https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3530.

Essentially, servers (such as Synapse) may not allow profile lookup over federation. For example, Synapse will return an HTTP 403 in response to `GET /_matrix/client/v3/profile/{userId}` if `allow_profile_lookup_over_federation` is set to `False`. This behavior is not currently documented in the spec. This proposal aims to add HTTP 403 to the list of responses to `GET /_matrix/client/v3/profile/{userId}`.
