The idea here is to use a password hashing function (like Bcrypt) on the client side, to turn one secret (the user's password) into two secrets that we can use for the login password and the SSSS password.

Everything described in this proposal can be done entirely on the client.  No changes are required on the server.

In some ways, this proposal might be viewed as a simpler alternative to [MSC2957](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2957) and [MSC3262](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3262).  Unlike those proposals, this one does not protect the (new, computed) login password against an adversary who owns the homeserver or its CDN.  It does, however, prevent such an adversary from obtaining the user's SSSS key.

The proposed scheme has been implemented in Swift in the beta version of [Circles](https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios).
