This is an additional attempt to cut down initial sync size and time. Construct implemented something similar for a while, but it wasn't opt in and as such broke clients. I do think the general idea is good though and would help with initial syncs, which can take more than 30 minutes at the moment, even with lazy loading of room members enabled. Conduit also expressed interest in something like this, if I remember correctly, but don't quote me on that.

The key names are subject to bikeshedding and I am open for better suggestions.
