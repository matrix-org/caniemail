Fixes #2024
[full proposal](https://github.com/stalniy/matrix-doc/blob/sse-support/proposals/2108-sync-via-server-sent-events.md)

## Introduction

Currently, Matrix clients use long polling to get the latest state from the server, it becomes an issue when you have a lot of clients because:
* homeserver needs to process a lot of requests, which by the way may return nothing
* it affects network bandwidth, each time client sends request it creates a new HTTP request with headers, cookies and other stuff
* for mobile clients, it spends their cellular Internet and eats money
* when homeserver uses SSL over HTTP (what is recommended), clients are doing again and again the most expensive operation, the TLS handshake

So, instead of long polling I propose to implement sync logic over [Server Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)(SSE)

## Proposal

[Server Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)(SSE) is a way for servers to push events to clients. It was a part of HTML5 standard and now available in all major web and mobile browsers.
It was specifically designed to overcome challenges related to short/long polling. By introducing this technology, we can get the next benefits:
* only 1 persisted connection per client that is kept open "forever".
* SSE is built on top of HTTP protocol, so can be used in communication between servers
* SSE is more compliant with existing IT infrastructure like (Load Balancer, Firewall, etc)
* web and mobile browsers support automatic reconnection and `Last-Event-Id` header out of the box
* Matrix protocol is built over HTTP, so SSE should fit good in protocol specification
