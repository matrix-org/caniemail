[Rendered](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/travis/msc/simplified-join-rules/proposals/3613-combined-join-rules.md)

This proposal is intended as a shorter term solution while other MSCs, like [MSC3386](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3386), work out a potentially all-new system.

Proof of concept implementation: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11668
