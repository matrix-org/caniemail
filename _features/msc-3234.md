[Rendered](https://github.com/LecrisUT/matrix-doc/blob/client_bot-active-room/proposals/3234-client-bot-current-active-room.md)

This MSC is closed in light of two aspects:
- Main issue: The original application for bridges falls apart when there are clients/users who do not subscribe to such tracking. If there are other applications this could be resolved. The discussion is in @penn5's [review](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3234#discussion_r650172647).
- Risk of abuse and tracking users via leaked metadata. The discussion is in @kevincox's [review](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3234#discussion_r649537731).

Please continue discussion there and re-open if there is new developments.
