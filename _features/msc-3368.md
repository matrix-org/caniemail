Initially I suggested most of this in a [comment](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3286#discussion_r675917250) under [MSC3286](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3286) but that MSC has been inactive for over a month now and I felt like my suggested changes were big enough to warrant a separate MSC.
