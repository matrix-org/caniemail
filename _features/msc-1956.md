See https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1286
Discussion room: [#msc-integrations-api:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#msc-integrations-api:t2bot.io)

**Note**: Currently this proposal is not ready for review in its entirety. The actual contents of the Integrations API are not yet fully defined, and other proposals must get approved before this proposal can officially work through the process. This is being opened now to have a reference number for all things Integrations API though.

Feedback on whether the concept of an Integrations API makes sense is welcome though, even if the final contents are still well within the draft status.

**Required proposals**:
* [MSC1951 - Custom emoji and sticker packs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1951)
* [MSC1957 - Integration manager discovery](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1957)
* [MSC1958 - Widget architecture changes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1958)
* [MSC1959 - Sticker picker API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1959)
* [MSC1960 - OpenID information exchange for widgets](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1960)
* [MSC1961 - Integration manager authentication APIs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1961)
* [MSC2140 - Terms of Service handling](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2140)
* [MSC2315 - Selecting 'none' as an integration manager](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2315)
