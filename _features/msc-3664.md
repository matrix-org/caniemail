[Rendered](https://github.com/deepbluev7/matrix-doc/blob/notifications-for-relations/proposals/3664-notifications-for-relations.md)

Partial implementation was done by Beeper, but without the appropriate namespacing and it is missing the filtering by `rel_type`: https://gitlab.com/beeper/synapse/-/commit/44a1728b6b021f97900c89e0c00f7d1a23ce0d43

Implementation: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11804 (Note: I have no idea, what I am doing)
