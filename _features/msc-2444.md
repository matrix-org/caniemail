A new MSC for proposing how peeking over federation could work, hopefully replacing #1777
This one introduces the idea of a `/peek` API in S2S which lets a peeking server subscribe to events from given server(s) so it can have a read-only peek view of peekable rooms.  This is based on the review of #1777 in Oct 2019.

Obsoletes #1777
