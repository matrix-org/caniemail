[Rendered](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/clokep/room-v8/proposals/3289-rooms-v8.md)

For links, here's the MSCs included:
* [MSC3083](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083) - Restricting room membership based on membership in other rooms

For reference there was #3097 filed, but it seems like most of those don't have implementations.

Implementation: matrix-org/synapse#10449
