I'm seeing more and more disasters with people failing to identify users correctly due to case sensitive IDs.  For instance Amandine's business cards say @&#8203;amandine:matrix.org whereas she's registered as @&#8203;Amandine:matrix.org.

Splitting this out from [SYN-78](https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SYN-78)
