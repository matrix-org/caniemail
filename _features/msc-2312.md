[Matrix room for interim discussions](https://matrix.to/#/#uri-scheme-proposal:matrix.org) - to keep lower traffic in the pull request, please discuss in the Matrix room if you just need a clarification or would like to discuss a possible change before proposing. If you have what you see as specific feedback, please comment on the specific line in the proposal rather than leave a comment to the whole PR.
