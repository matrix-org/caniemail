The key `notifications` was added to the `m.room.power_levels` event after the finalisation of the auth rules specified in room version 1. This leads to the fact, that this dictionary is not subject to the same validation as other dictionaries in the event, such as `users` or `events`. This especially means that Alice is able to alter any entry within the dictionary including ones, that are above her own power level, which is inconsistent with the behaviour for the other two dictionaries.
