Intended to address:
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1919
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1896
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2335

If there are any other issues with the client well-known that I've missed let me know so there doesn't need to be a followup MSC.
